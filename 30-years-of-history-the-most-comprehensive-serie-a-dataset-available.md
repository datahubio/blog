In the early 2000s, AC Milan built Milan Lab -  **a performance analysis system that used medical, physical, and tactical data to manage player fitness.** It helped extend the careers of stars like Paolo Maldini and Clarence Seedorf. While rivals relied on instinct and tradition, Milan used data-driven insights on player fatigue, injury prevention, and tactical efficiency - leading to Champions League triumphs and Serie A dominance.

Fast-forward to today, and every high-level football professional - coaches, investors, journalists, and bookmakers - knows that data is the game behind the game.

That’s why we built the **Italian Serie A Dataset, a goldmine of detailed match data from 1990-1991** to the current season designed for those who want to make smarter bets, sharper analyses, and better performance. 

## 1\. The Italian Serie A dataset identikit

From tactical deep dives to investment insights, this dataset offers everything from full-time results to advanced metrics like shot accuracy, disciplinary records, and corner patterns. We value the football industry professionals’ need for reliable information on a wide range of statistics. That’s why we decided to address more than 20 variables for each game: 

* Home and away **team**;
* **Date** and **referee**;
* **Results** and **goals** both at half-time and full-time.

For the ones looking for even more detailed information, we included also **each team**’s counts for:

* Total and on-target **shots**;
* **Fouls** committed;
* **Yellow** and **red cards**;
* **Corners**.

Last but not least, data visualization can be complex when dealing with large amounts of data, which is why you can easily consult our **previews** for the last five seasons of the English Premier League.

## 2\. Highlights \- The dataset features

The Italian Serie A dataset is part of a DataHub project that collected and structured comprehensive data on the **five major European football** leagues.
