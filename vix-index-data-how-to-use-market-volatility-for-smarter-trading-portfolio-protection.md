If you are into trading at any level, you know it: **no feeling is better than observing the market sentiment and knowing exactly what to do next**.

Back in the late ‚Äò80s, Professors Brenner and Galai laid the Sigma Index (SI), the theoretical foundation to measure the **expected volatility of the stock market for the next 30 days**. By 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange ([CBOE](https://www.cboe.com/)) refined its calculation with Professor Whaley of Duke University, finally announcing the birth of the [**CBOE Volatility Index**](https://datahub.io/core/finance-vix) **([VIX](https://datahub.io/core/finance-vix))**.

Ever since then, VIX fluctuations have mirrored the **major historical events** in international macroeconomy and politics:

* On **24 October 2008**, one month after **Lehman Brother‚Äôs bankruptcy**, the VIX rocketed to 89.53, recording its maximum record ever;
* Right after the 2008 crisis peak, all of the other 4 highest levels of VIX ever were recorded in **March 2020**, with the **outburst of the Covid-19 pandemic** in the USA;
* Notwithstanding **widespread geopolitical instability** and US Presidential elections, the VIX **during 2024** was generally low \- except for recording the [biggest percentage spike](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/wall-streets-fear-gauge-the-vix-saw-second-biggest-spike-ever-on-wednesday.html) in December.

How does this resonate with **your current investment decisions**?

We created a quick guide to the **CBOE volatility index**, and how our [daily updated dataset](https://datahub.io/core/finance-vix) can change your financial future.

## 1\. The CBOE VIX: how it works

Let‚Äôs take a step back.

The [CBOE Volatility Index](https://datahub.io/core/finance-vix) ([VIX](https://datahub.io/core/finance-vix)) was officially announced in 1993, offering a refined tool to forecast the **market‚Äôs volatility during the 30 following days**. However, as also showcased in our dataset, rough calculations for its values were launched in 1990\.

Often expressed in percentage terms, it has an **inverse relationship to the S\&P 500 value**:

* If the VIX value rises, the S\&P 500 value decreases;
* If the VIX value decreases, the S\&P 500 value rises and stays stable.

The VIX has imposed itself as the **benchmark to evaluate the stress within the American stock market**, with values under 20 usually indicating a relaxed environment. That‚Äôs how it has gained the nickname ‚Äú[**fear and greed index**](https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed)‚Äù.

As the existent volatility cannot be known beforehand, the CBOE Volatility Index is used by finance professionals in combination with **historical support analyses and market resistance lines** (source: [IG Bank](https://www.ig.com/it-ch/indici/cosa-e-indice-vix-come-fare-trading)). What you may not know, however, is that you can use it to:

* **Inform your decisions** on other positions;
* **Prevent stock losses** during declining periods;
* **Speculate** on the market volatility itself.

## 2\. The CBOE Volatility Index: how professionals exploit it

Many investors use the CBOE Volatility Index most directly, as a gauge of market sentiment to **adjust their stock or bond positions**. Rather intuitively, using the VIX to assess market sentiment can facilitate risk assessment and strategic allocation to different products. For instance:

* **Low VIX levels** may lead to **favor stocks and equities**;
* **High VIX** \- especially if during a sustained period \- would point towards **defensive assets** (like bonds or gold).

Investors and traders also speculate on market swings by **directly levereging VIX-related products** \- such as [futures](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/vix_futures/) and [options](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/vix_options/). Put simply, this means that instead of just using the index as a guide for managing your portfolio, you can **take advantage of volatility itself**, profiting from market fluctuations.

In an [in-depth analysis](https://www.etoro.com/news-and-analysis/in-depth-analysis/the-vix-your-anti-market-crash-shield/) for e-Toro, popular investor Marie Am√©lie Biette offered a clear bullet-point list about how to use data on VIX as a **defensive strategy**:

1. **Hedging to counterbalance market declines**, holding VIX futures or options to prevent portfolio losses during market declines;
2. **Dampen the impact of unforeseen events**, mostly linked to major geopolitical events;
3. **Preserving an upside potential** even during violent market fluctuations, especially for diversified portfolios.

The [CBOE Volatility Index](https://datahub.io/core/finance-vix) can also be **traded directly**. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2012/4-ways-to-trade-the-vix-vxx-vxz-tvix-xxv0504.aspx) underlined that most speculation on it is linked to buying ETFs and ETNs, with the caveat to remember that their behavior may sometimes differ substantially from volatility expectations. One of the most aggressive (and risky) strategies consists in [**shorting the VIX**](https://www.tradingsim.com/blog/mastering-the-art-of-shorting-the-vix-strategies-for-volatility-trading), which gained popularity before the Volmageddon crash on February 5th, 2018 (source: [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-06/the-day-the-vix-doubled-tales-of-volmageddon)).
