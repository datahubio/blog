In 2022, over **161 billion parcels** were shipped worldwide: we are talking about more than 20 packages per living person! What is even more incredible is that the **estimated compound annual growth rate has been updated to 8%**, leading to a shocking 256 billion by 2027 (source: [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230809471409/en/Pitney-Bowes-Parcel-Shipping-Index-Confirms-Extended-Effects-of-COVID-19-Lockdowns-on-Chinese-Shipping-Through-2022?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

As international shipping companies and trading professionals rapidly expand their business, inconsistent data on postal codes can still lead them into a **real logistical nightmare**.

According to a [Loquate](https://www.loqate.com/it/) report, **address inaccuracies derail a staggering 80% of deliveries**, causing costly delays (41%) and tout-court failures (39%).

However, postal codes are necessary to ship in more than **160 countries** all over the world (source: [Universal Postal Union](https://www.upu.int/en/home)), with many of them using **different labeling systems** and allowing for internal differentiations. What if you could access a **single, reliable source** for postal codes from **over 239 regions**, complete with coordinates, alternative names, and administrative divisions?

Dive into a solution trusted by businesses worldwide to streamline their processes and eliminate the guesswork\!

Our mission with this solution is to **operationalize and rationalize data** that can be by nature inconsistent in their coverage, mostly because of their high granularity.

Each of the datasets that we offer has a matchless detail level, including four types of variables:

* The **country code**;

* The place‚Äôs **coordinates** and their accuracy;
* Names and codes for primary, secondary, and third-level **administrative divisions**.

Through this solution, we allow you to have complete information not only about the local administrative categories but also about ‚Äú**disturbing elements**‚Äù that could maim their localizations. Being fully transparent, the datasets let the user **predict possible inaccuracies** about the actual geographical localization of any given place.

## 2\. The worth of our dataset of global postal codes

Put simply, [DataHub.io‚Äôs collection](https://datahub.io/collections/postal-codes-datasets) lets you gather any kind of information about the postal codes of a place with **just a few clicks**. We aimed to tackle at least t**hree of the most common problems** for shipping logistics:

* National administrations worldwide follow very **different categorization systems**, slowing down international delivery companies that don‚Äôt have access to homogeneous and actionable data;
* Some regions **frequently update** postal codes due to national bureaucratic necessities, requiring businesses to constantly review the correctness of their data;
* Changes in the international geopolitical scenario can lead to **massive transformations** in the postal code systems, and companies dealing with politically unstable areas are often exposed to unexpected derails.
