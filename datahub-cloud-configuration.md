# DataHub Cloud Configuration: Personalize Your DataHub Website

DataHub Cloud empowers you to personalize your website using a configuration file named `config.json`. This file resides in your project's root directory and enables you to customize various visual elements of your DataHub Cloud website.

## Craft a Unique Identity for Your DataHub Website

With `config.json`, you can design a distinctive identity for your DataHub Cloud website. Here's a breakdown of the configurable properties:

- **Website Title:** This property sets the title that displays at the top of your browser window. Make it catchy and informative!
- **Website Description:** Provide a concise description of your DataHub Cloud website using the `description` property. This description can be helpful for new users who are unfamiliar with your project's purpose.
- **Author:** Let everyone know who created this amazing DataHub Cloud website by attributing it to yourself or your team using the `author` property.

### Putting it all Together: A Sample Configuration

Here's an example of a `config.json` file that demonstrates how to configure these properties:

JSON

```json
{
  "title": "My Awesome DataHub Website",
  "description": "This is a customized DataHub Cloud website for managing our company's data",
  "author": "The Data Engineering Team"
}
```

By incorporating a `config.json` file, you can transform your DataHub Cloud website into a personalized and informative experience for all users.
