Imagine this scenario: you have an **incredible idea**. You just crafted a data analysis that could contribute to the **community**â€™s knowledge. You are proud of your work and you **cannot wait to share** the fruits of your (hard) work.Â 

Yet, you cannot find a **code-free platform** where you can just click and share, without losing your time - and mind - going through infinite processes.Â   

**DataHub Cloud has your back**.Â 

Built with love by [Datopian](https://www.datopian.com/), our publishing system allows seamless sharing of data-centered projects, **uplifting you** from any worry and jam. In this article you can discover how to **just worry about your data**, and let us take care of everything else.Â 
## The value of open source projects

**Data democratization** is [DataHub.io](https://datahub.io/)â€™s core value. For us, this concept means not only sharing **thousands of open-source datasets** for anyone to use, but also, even more, **creating a community** where the exchange of ideas and knowledge leads to collective growth.

Letâ€™s be clear: weâ€™re not talking about abstract concepts. First and foremost, betting on open-source projects means **valuing people**, their work, and eventually their **economic well-being**.

According to Jobera, **68%** of a sample of 500 **developers** reported having **learned coding** through resources made available by other users. Moreover, from the very first steps into the world of data analysis, **external feedback** can improve your work, while fostering your portfolio for future projects.Â 

And if you think open-source resources donâ€™t bring **financial returns**, youâ€™d be mistaken.

According to a 2013 estimate by the [McKinsey Global Institute](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/open-data-unlocking-innovation-and-performance-with-liquid-information) open data had the potential to unlock **USD 3 billion each year** already in 2013. Part of this wealth now comes from **cost reductions** for businesses: **1 in 3 companies** manages to achieve **long-term savings** by opting for open-source solutions over proprietary ones ([Jobera](https://jobera.com/open-source-software-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## Open source secondo DataHub.io

What better way to democratize data than by offering a **completely free and open-source** service for **publishing projects**?

![[v03publishteam.svg]]

Firmly believing in the **power of community** and **knowledge exchange**, the [DataHub.io](https://datahub.io/) team has centered its publishing service around four fundamental pillars. From the outset, we aimed to create a tool that is:

- **Easy to use**, suitable for data analysts of all levels, fostering idea sharing even for those still developing their data literacy;
- **[Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPWWRV6gbA&t=60s)-based**, making it accessible not only for reading but also (and especially) for writing;
- **Hosted for you**, providing all the basic functionalities you're accustomed to while adding a technical stack for visualizations tailored to different needs;
- **Run-off GitHub**, allowing you to work on a platform you already know, without requiring extra effort just to publish a ready-to-go project.

Just like our [global solutions](https://datahub.io/blog/global-data-solutions-curated-datasets-for-informed-business-decisions), our publishing tool **dynamically adapts to your needs**, letting you transform your GitHub repositories into data-rich sites in just a few clicks - no coding required.
## How to publish step by step

DataHub.io makes **[publishing personal projects ](https://datahub.io/publish)** a kidsâ€™ game.Â 

Directly syncing with your GitHub, it allows you to manage and publish your analyses where you are already comfortable working. You just need to take care of your data, while we worry about everything else.Â
