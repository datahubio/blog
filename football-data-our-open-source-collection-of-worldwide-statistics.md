## 1\. Highlights \- what makes our collection crucial

DataHub.io’s mission to democratize data extends to one of the most influential global industries: sports and, specifically, **football's financial power**.

Up to the 2022/2023 season, European leagues' total revenues reached **€35.5 billion**, with the English Premier League alone recording a €7 billion profit. Most notably, the incomes of the five major European leagues have been **constantly growing** ever since 2010, with only a minor setback during the pandemic (source: [El País](https://elpais.com/economia/2024-11-13/las-grandes-ligas-europeas-de-futbol-en-respiracion-asistida-crecen-los-ingresos-pero-no-compensan-la-deuda-cronificada.html)).

But how does this growth translate to the **wider economy**?

Football financial management increasingly relies on debt, fostering an internal urge to constantly **seek high-return** projects and partnerships. This strategy, combined with football’s immense visibility, makes clubs perfect clients for other businesses’ advertisements and communication.

**Bookmaking** represents a parallel but not less profitable track. European revenues from online betting alone were **$20 billion** in 2023, and they are forecast to more than double in 30 years (source: [Custom Market Insights](https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/europe-online-sports-betting-market/)).

This growth is amplified by major international events, which offer prime opportunities for **global advertisement** and **gambling activities**. During the 2022 World Cup, FIFA's income from rights alone peaked at a record-high **$6,314 million**. The positive trend was mirrored by the 65% revenue increase for betting companies (source: Bloomberg).

The [**Football Data collection**](https://datahub.io/collections/football) is the perfect means to support business analysis and decision-making in this dynamic field.
