You can now see publisher and dataset related events. As we are tracking processes happening in our system, users have ability to discover which publishers have been active or datasets are updated frequently.

In the dashboard page, users can monitor their own private activity as well as their datasets' statuses:

If you want to see events for the specific dataset, you can check "events" page for it. Simply concatenate `/events` path for your dataset's URL - `https://datahub.io/{publisher}/{dataset}/events`. E.g., here is the "events" page for "finance-vix" dataset - https://datahub.io/core/finance-vix/events - it includes the most recent events for the dataset:
