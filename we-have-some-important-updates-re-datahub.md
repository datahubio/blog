Hi there,

We’d like to let you know about some upcoming changes to DataHub.io! We’re actively working on DataHub after a period when things were a bit quiet.


#### **🏗️ Upcoming Improvements**

We’ve got some big plans which we will be sharing about in future mails. For now, the main thing to know is that we are planning a full upgrade of the experience. **If you're interested in getting early access to the new experience, click the button below:**

**UPDATE: the new experience is live! To sign up visit 👉 https://datahub.io/**

#### **🚩 Important Changes**

Today, what we wanted to flag is that:

**Signup will be disabled (for a little while)**

Part of the upgrade will involve upgrading the current signup / login  functionality (which as some of you may have noticed has been having some issues). As such, we will be disabling the signup functionality over the next few weeks.

**Login (on the site) may also be affected**

Because of the way current DataHub.io is designed this may also affect login so we wanted to flag this to you so you are aware.

**We want to emphasize that throughout the upcoming phase of upgrades and improvements your data won’t be touched and will remain safe and sound!**

 

Best,

_Rufus Pollock, Ola Rubaj and the DataHub Team_
