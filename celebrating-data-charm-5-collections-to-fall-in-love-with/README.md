![v04-climate-change-data-warming](./v04-climate-change-data-warming.svg)

Climate change data remains one of the most contested issues in both online and societal debates. In 2020, **nearly half a million posts on Twitter denied the crisis** (source: [NRDC](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/climate-misinformation-social-media-undermining-climate-action)), while **15% of Americans still reject its existence** \- as outlined by an [AI-based study](https://news.umich.edu/nearly-15-of-americans-deny-climate-change-is-real-ai-study-finds/) from the University of Michigan.
