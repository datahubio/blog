In the world of data, accessibility and quality are crucial. As we move into the next phase of DataHub.io, our goal is to make it the go-to place for finding essential and popular datasets. Alongside that, we're building a seamless experience for data publishers to upload and showcase their datasets. Over time, we envision this evolving into a vibrant data marketplace.

## Our Focus for the Next 3-6 Months

To realize this vision, we are dedicating the next few months to several key improvements:

### Enhanced Dataset Showcase Pages

We‚Äôre transforming dataset pages into rich, informative showcases. Our goal is for users to quickly grasp the dataset‚Äôs metadata, preview the data, and understand the schema in detail. We‚Äôll offer comprehensive insights into the structure and contents of each dataset, empowering users to make informed decisions.

### Keeping Core Datasets Up-to-Date

We understand that having up-to-date data is essential. Therefore, we‚Äôre putting considerable effort into fixing, improving, and regularly updating our core datasets. This way, you can always rely on DataHub.io for the most current and accurate information.

### Bringing Back the Popular `r` Links

Our popular `r` links will be reintroduced, allowing users to integrate their apps seamlessly with DataHub.io datasets. This means faster, more convenient access to the data you rely on, in the format you need.

### Improving Dataset Discovery

We‚Äôre prioritizing enhancements to the dataset discovery experience. Our focus is on making it easier than ever for users to find the data they need. This involves rethinking our search capabilities and introducing new ways to browse datasets, whether by topic, popularity, or recent updates.

## Exploring Geodata and Reference Information

Organizations that operate globally need reliable sources of geopolitical data. That's why we are focusing on enhancing our collection of geodata, which includes:

- **üåç Country Lists and Standard Codes:** Access comprehensive lists of countries with their official codes.
- **‚òéÔ∏è Telephone Codes:** Find updated and accurate dialing codes for every nation.
- **üõ´ Airports, Continents, and Regions:** Get global references for airports, continents, and regional divisions.
- **üï∞ Timezones and Holidays Data:** Use detailed information on global timezones and holiday calendars.

This initiative ensures that DataHub.io remains the primary source for essential geopolitical reference data.

## Comprehensive Postal Codes for Over 100 Countries

In addition to geodata, we are creating an extensive dataset of postal codes for over 100 countries. This dataset will contain premium data, including:

- Country names and their standard codes
- Detailed administrative divisions, such as states, provinces, and cities
- Postal codes for precise regional identification

This will serve as an invaluable resource for businesses, researchers, and developers needing accurate postal code information for logistics, marketing, or analysis.

## What‚Äôs Next?

Our efforts in the next 3-6 months lay the groundwork for a comprehensive data marketplace on DataHub.io. By enhancing dataset discovery, improving showcase pages, and updating core datasets regularly, we aim to build a robust platform that serves both data consumers and publishers.

As we continue to grow, we are eager to hear from our community. Your feedback is instrumental in shaping the future of DataHub.io. We invite you to join us on this journey as we work to make high-quality, accessible data available to everyone.

Stay tuned for more updates, and explore the new and improved DataHub.io today!
