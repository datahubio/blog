I've recently found [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a tool makes it easy to publish Jupyter notebooks as static websites. [It is probably also the one that produces the most beautiful content without much effort](https://quartoexample.pages.dev/).

For Python folks like me, is really great! Other great features I've found are:

- Supports Python, R and JS.
- Offers a custom notebook format if you want to be closer to Markdown.
- Lots of examples, templates, and extensions (e.g: [running a SQLite database on the HTML document](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/interactive-sql))

While I need to dig further into this idea, I think it be really great as a way to publish data rich documents. With WASM, you could provide an `/explore` tab with the data, a Tableau/ like experience, and a SQL/Python/JS playground.
