The Country List dataset is one of the most essential core datasets we maintain at DataHub. It provides a simple, up-to-date list of countries with their official English names and 2 digit codes (ISO 3166-1) in a developer-friendly CSV format. This dataset is available via DataHub.io at [Country List Dataset](https://datahub.io/core/country-list), where you can access metadata and download the data for use in various applications.

Recently, we made an important update to the dataset, ensuring its continued accuracy and relevance. You can view the latest changes in this [commit](https://github.com/datasets/country-list/commit/260b00e5317b51836cdcc48c51c70d3fa8b85d73). This update has now been published on DataHub.io, ensuring users have immediate access to the most current data.

At Datopian, we are committed to maintaining the quality and availability of these open datasets. Our team ensures that the data remains accessible and reliable for all users, whether they are developers, data scientists, or researchers.

As part of our ongoing efforts to make this data even more accessible, we are planning to publish the Country List dataset on NPM. This will enable JavaScript developers to easily fetch and integrate the data into their applications, making it even more convenient to work with.

Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to explore the dataset on [DataHub.io](https://datahub.io/core/country-list).
