We are happy to present new datasets extracted from [open-ml](https://www.openml.org/home) website. You can find them at our machine-learning datasets [page](https://www.datahub.io/machine-learning). OpenML is a hub for sharing interesting open source machine learning datasets. It links data to algorithms and people, so you can build on the state of the art and learn to teach machines to learn better. Some of the most popular datasets among our users for you to take a look at:

* [Vehicle silhouettes](https://www.datahub.io/machine-learning/vehicle)
* [Diabetes](https://www.datahub.io/machine-learning/diabetes)
* [Musk](https://www.datahub.io/machine-learning/musk) 


We extracted 100 most downloaded datasets from OpenML for you to practice and solve problems. We hope that you will find them useful and informative.
