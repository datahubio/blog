MarkdownDB continues to evolve, introducing new features to enhance the management of Markdown files. In this blog post, we're thrilled to present three exciting features: export to JSON files, task extraction, and computed fields.

## Export to JSON files üì§

MarkdownDB now supports the seamless export of data to JSON files, offering enhanced flexibility in managing your MarkdownDB content.
```bash
npx mddb ./content
```

This will generate a `.markdowndb/files.json` file that contains metadata extracted from all the files in the `content` folder.

**Output example:**

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "7e01cae193f12f5a4a9be2b89f22b429761bd313",
    "file_path": "blog/hello-world.md",
    "extension": "md",
    "url_path": "blog/hello-world",
    "filetype": null,
    "metadata": {
      "author": "John Doe",
      "date": "2023-12-01"
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

## Task extraction üìã

MarkdownDB makes managing tasks easier with its new task extraction feature. Now, you can quickly find and organize your tasks, making tracking your tasks more straightforward.

For example:

```md
---
  title: markdowndb
  description: "Javascript library for treating markdown files as a database"
---
- [x] Do laundry
```

When you run the query below:
```sql
SELECT metadata FROM files;
```

The output will resemble the following JSON structure:
```json
"metadata": {
  "title": "markdowndb",
  "description": "Javascript library for treating markdown files as a database",
  "tasks": [{
    "description": "Do laundry",
    "checked": true
  }]
}
```

Say goodbye to manual task tracking as **MarkdownDB** helps you handle tasks within your Markdown content. Embrace a more efficient and automated solution for task extraction and management.

## Computed Fields ü§ñ

Explore enhanced functionality with Computed Fields, an advanced feature that allows users to create custom functions for dynamic field computation, enriching the depth of Markdown content.

Users can define a function that takes the file object and the file's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), enabling them to add fields to it as needed.

For example, consider the function `addTitle`, designed to extract the title from the first heading in the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of a Markdown file using JavaScript.

Then you can index the folder 
```javascript
client.indexFolder(folderPath: "PATH_TO_FOLDER", customConfig: { computedFields: [addTitle] });
```

MarkdownDB ensures that the computed title is included in the database.
