2024 marked a turning point for **Spanish La Liga**, which hosted a series of conferences showcasing its **efforts to integrate data analytics**. Co-hosted by three leading universities, the events were described in a press release as ‚Äúone of the most important football analysis events of the year,‚Äù highlighting a ‚Äúmilestone in the convergence of **professional football and advanced technology**‚Äù. 

With data now considered [the new gold](https://datahub.io/blog/global-data-solutions-curated-datasets-for-informed-business-decisions), it‚Äôs no surprise that the world‚Äôs most popular sport is leveraging it to drive **decision-making processes that move trillions of dollars** each year. Spain‚Äôs top league is just one of many professional competitions systematically relying on technological advancements to **enhance performance and revenue**:

* **Italian Serie A** data plays a key role in one of the world‚Äôs most profitable betting markets;  
* **German Bundesliga** leads the way in using real-time data to enhance football narratives and fan engagement.

Recognizing growing need for reliable data, [DataHub.io](http://DataHub.io) has curated a [comprehensive collection of datasets](https://datahub.io/collections/football) to support professionals across the football industry. Our goal is to **provide compact, trustworthy, and continuously updated data** for every match.

That‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôve aimed to deliver with our [Spanish La Liga datasets](https://datahub.io/core/spanish-la-liga): keep reading if you‚Äôre curious to learn more\!

## 1\. The Spanish La Liga dataset identikit

From performance analysis to entertainment, **Spanish La Liga is increasingly leveraging data** to drive innovation and boost revenue. However, despite its massive revenue-generation figures, football remains, at its core, a **simple game defined by single matches**.

This is why our [Spanish La Liga datasets](https://datahub.io/core/spanish-la-liga), spanning from 1993 to the present day, focus on team statistics for each encounter. As the availability of data has grown over the years, so has the depth of our analysis.

[Our datasets](https://datahub.io/core/spanish-la-liga) offered progressively more detailed insights, now including **more than 20 variables per game**. On the one hand, football professionals can easily isolate basic details such as: 

* Home and Away team;  
* Date;  
* Referee.

On the other hand, they can also dive deeper into **specific match dynamics**. These include both half-time and full-time results and goals, alongside specific data per team: 

* Total and on-target shots;   
* Fouls committed;   
* Yellow and red cards;   
* Corners. 

[DataHub.io](http://DataHub.io) decided to open-source and provide also the **current season‚Äôs statistics**, which are **updated daily** through Travis-CI, not to leave anyone behind.  And, to facilitate comprehension of the datasets‚Äô insights, we have also included **previews** for five seasons starting from the 1995-96 one. 

## 2\. Highlights \- The dataset features

The [Spanish La Liga datasets](https://datahub.io/core/spanish-la-liga) belong to a [broader opensource collection](https://datahub.io/collections/football) that DataHub.io wrapped for its community, encompassing all the information football professionals chase with curated datasets for the **five major European leagues**.

## 3\. How to use the Spanish La Liga datasets

Although fitting data analysts of any level and kind, our [European major leagues' football datasets](https://datahub.io/collections/football) were all crafted to **enable data-driven decision making** for professionals. This very well applies to the [Spanish La Liga collection](https://datahub.io/core/spanish-la-liga), leveraging on consistency and constant updates to meet the necessities of different football-related businesses. 

But how can professionals in the football industry specifically implement data to empower innovation? 

* **Investors and stakeholders**: La Liga clubs are not the fastest growing in Europe if taken altogether, as shown by their slightly inferior revenues increases if compared to the German Bundesliga. However, some spearhead examples are setting global records \- just consider that Real Madrid became the first to surpass EU 1 billion in generated revenues in the 2023-24 season.  
	* Data-driven money allocation  
	* Spotting the most consistent clubs  
	* Individuate possibly profitable underdogs


* **Team management**: did you know that the legendary coach Carlo Ancelotti and his Chief analyst [Simone Montanaro](https://www.transfermarkt.com/simone-montanaro/profil/trainer/45360) have been leveraging data analytics to enhance their teams‚Äô performances ever since their experience at SSN Napoli? Not only so, but in July 2024, leading clubs such as Sevilla FC have shared their experience in leveraging real-time advanced analytics to back their in-match decision-making through Mediacoach Sandbox at a [conference](https://www.laliga.com/en-GB/news/laliga-becomes-the-epicentre-for-big-data-in-football-during-july) hosted by La Liga and three Spanish leading universities.   
	* Improve performance and organization  
	* Craft targeted training sessions  
	* Individuation of critical spots  
	* Matchday preparation

* **Marketing and advertisement**: according to [Third Bridge research](https://thirdbridge.com/transcripts/laliga-spanish-football-leagues-league-analysis-media-rights-structure/), media rights represent nine tenths of La Liga‚Äôs revenue stream, considering that only 60% come from Spain. Combined with the astonishing advertisement figures of FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, this insight underscores the extreme potential of La Liga clubs and sponsorship partners not only within national boundaries, but globally.   
	* Spot possible partnerships  
	* Identify the most consistent and/or spectacular teams  
	* Evaluate the team‚Äôs possible public appeal 


* **Betting industry**: according to [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/europe-sports-betting-market-report), the European sports betting market was valued at approximately **USD 33.75 billion in 2023** and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.9% from 2024 to 2030\. Just like the [German Bundesliga](https://datahub.io/core/german-bundesliga), Spanish La Liga is not among the top-rated betting leagues. This could represent a **challenge**, but also a gambling market with fewer competitors.  
	* Bookmaking support  
	* Individuation of profitable commercial partners  
	* Leverage data to maximize returns on odd wagers


* **Journalists and content creators**: the iconic FC Barcelona‚Äôs tiki-taka or Real Madrid‚Äôs explosiveness are just the finest expressions of a football league that has been **consistently offering spectacular matches** for many decades. Our datasets make hype building and historical analysis of specific combinations particularly easy, bringing football narratives to the next level.   
	* Building hype before a game  
	* Postgame analysis  
	* Recalling iconic matches of the past  
	* Agile creation of half-time flashcards

Overall, our [Spanish La Liga datasets](https://datahub.io/core/spanish-la-liga) transform football data into **actionable insights**, aiding decision-making for a broad spectrum of experts, from team management to the bookmaking industry.
