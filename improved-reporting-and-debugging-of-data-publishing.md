We've integrated our pipelines system with the website to display more insights to our users. Any dataset you publish on DataHub could be in one of three states: **processing**, **succeeded** or **failed**. Below we explain each state in detail.

## Processing

While your dataset is being processed, you can see a dataset page with information about currently running steps. For instance, it might be creating a JSON version of your tabular data or validating it against a table schema:

![](/static/img/docs/processing-dataset.gif)

## Succeeded

This is just a regular dataset page you have seen before:

![](/static/img/docs/succeeded-dataset.png)

## Failed

If processing a dataset has failed, you would see a notice about it with a pipeline title that caused the error. You can also expand the error to read the logs and find out the reason for the failure:

![](/static/img/docs/failed-dataset.gif)


## Different versions of your dataset

Each time you publish your dataset, a revision process is triggered for it. You can consider a revision as a version of your dataset, e.g., if it is the first time you have published a particular dataset, it would have version 1 (and the next revision would increment version by 1 so it'd be 2):

`https://datahub.io/<username>/<dataset>/v/1`

It becomes useful when you've re-published your dataset several times and you want to get your data in a specific stage.


>[!info]A version is a natural number (integer larger than 0) and you can access the specific version of a dataset by:
`/v/{number}`.
