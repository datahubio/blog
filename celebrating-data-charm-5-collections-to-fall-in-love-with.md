## 3\. Climate change: a tainted love collection

[**Climate Change data**](https://datahub.io/collections/climate-change) has had a **troubled relationship with humankind**. Yet, despite facing skepticism, the facts persist \- trusting us to make it actionable and protect our future.

![v04-climate-change-data-warming](/assets/v04-climate-change-data-warming.svg)

Climate change data remains one of the most contested issues in both online and societal debates. In 2020, **nearly half a million posts on Twitter denied the crisis** (source: [NRDC](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/climate-misinformation-social-media-undermining-climate-action)), while **15% of Americans still reject its existence** \- as outlined by an [AI-based study](https://news.umich.edu/nearly-15-of-americans-deny-climate-change-is-real-ai-study-finds/) from the University of Michigan.

**Amidst conflicting views and misinformation, numbers remain a constant anchor**. By drawing on both mainstream and independent sources like the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home) and [climate4you](https://www.climate4you.com/), our [**Climate Change collection**](https://datahub.io/collections/climate-change) empowers people by making their own opinions:

* In the same year, **US labor force participation dropped to 62.4%**, nearly a four-point decline in a decade (source: [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2024/article/labor-force-and-macroeconomic-projections-overview-and-highlights-2023-33.htm))
