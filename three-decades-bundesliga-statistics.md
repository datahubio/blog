You might not know this yet, but the **German Bundesliga** is the most technologically advanced European league when it comes to data analysis and innovation. This is especially true in **fan engagement and narrative building** \- an intriguing angle that sets it apart as a truly unique football league.

Think Iâ€™m exaggerating?

The Deutsche FuÃŸball Liga, responsible for the leagueâ€™s management, is currently actively involved in the implementation of **IT in four core areas**:

1. Creation of **Match Facts** with AI-powered fan engagement;
2. **AI Live Ticker**, a system creating compelling live commentary for matches;
3. Streamlining the **media production process** with generative AI;
4. Data-driven player performance and coaching.

Especially in a highly demanding environment such as modern football, **control over the match statistics** is what sets professionals apart from bare amateurs. Thatâ€™s why [DataHub.io](http://DataHub.io) decided to create a [**database for the German Bundesliga**](https://datahub.io/core/german-bundesliga), encompassing over 30 seasons of detailed information on one of the major European leagues.

## 1\. The German Bundesliga dataset identikit

## 3\. How to use the German Bundesliga datasets

Letâ€™s talk business: our data engineers have designed all our football datasets with professionals in mind. The German Bundesliga dataset is no exception, with its depth and consistency making it a valuable asset for **various kinds of football-related businesses**.

Now, letâ€™s explore the specific ways professionals in the football industry can leverage the [DataHub.io dataset](https://datahub.io/core/german-bundesliga):

* **Investors and stakeholders**: in the 2022/23 season, Bundesliga clubs experienced significant revenue **growth of 22%**, reaching a total of â‚¬3.8 billion. This increase was the **largest among Europe's 'big five' leagues**. Notably, Borussia Dortmund's revenue grew to â‚¬514 million in the 2023/24 season (source: [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/uk/en/services/financial-advisory/research/annual-review-of-football-finance-europe-premier-league.html)), possibly representing a good business partner.
  * Data-driven money allocation
  * Spotting the most consistent clubs
  * Individuate possibly profitable underdogs

* **Team management**: alongside the general Deutsche FuÃŸball Liga AI-led innovation through the [glass-to-grass strategy](https://www.dfl.de/en/innovation/dfl-performs-live-tests-of-remote-production-technology/), **Bayern Munich** has been the first team to openly invest in a **dedicated data analysis department** led by [Michael Niemeyer](https://de.linkedin.com/in/michaelniemeyer), that directly advises the coach and technical staff about possible. This decision was taken abroad also by [Manchester City](https://datahub.io/blog/advanced-statistics-english-premier-league-analysis) and [AS Roma](https://datahub.io/blog/30-years-of-history-the-most-comprehensive-serie-a-dataset-available) amongst others.
  * Improve performance and organization
  * Craft targeted training sessions
  * Individuation of critical spots

* **Marketing and advertisement**: sports narratives and their publicities are at the center of Bundesliga priorities, as also shown by the **AI-based** **commentary partnership** with Amazon Web Services. Can the German league be a good showcase? Suffice it to say that in the 2023-24 season, **media accounted for 34% of its total revenues** (source: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282825/percentage-segmentation-german-bundesliga-revenue/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
  * Spot possible partnerships
  * Identify the most consistent and/or spectacular teams
  * Evaluate the teamâ€™s possible public appeal

* **Betting industry**: according to [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/europe-sports-betting-market-report), the European sports betting market was valued at approximately **USD 33.75 billion in 2023** and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.9% from 2024 to 2030\. [German Bundesliga](https://datahub.io/core/german-bundesliga) is not among the top-rated betting leagues, which may represent a challenge, but also a gambling market with less competitors.
  * Bookmaking support
  * Individuation of profitable commercial partners
  * Leverage data to maximize returns on odd wagers

* **Journalists and content creators**: as we have already mentioned, the German Bundesliga puts a strong stress on **football narratives**, coming to the point of implementing AI to generate compelling live commentaries of the matches.
