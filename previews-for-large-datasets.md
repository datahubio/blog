We are now generating preview versions of large datasets so your web browser does not crash by loading large amount of data. The preview versions consist of first 5k rows of datasets (if a dataset is small enough, we skip generation of a preview version). For instance, take a look at [finance-vix dataset][finance-vix] preview table:

[finance-vix]: /core/finance-vix
