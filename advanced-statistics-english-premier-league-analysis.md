Data is the new **currency of football**, and the [English Premier League dataset](https://datahub.io/core/english-premier-league) is your key to unlocking its wealth.

At DataHub, we decided to share an open-source treasure: spanning **32 seasons** and packed with over **20 detailed variables** per match, we aim to offer unparalleled insights for professionals who want to strengthen their activity with sound figures.

After all, European football is a **constantly expanding market**, with total revenues being by now constantly over **â‚¬30 billion** per year ([El PaÃ­s](https://elpais.com/economia/2024-11-13/las-grandes-ligas-europeas-de-futbol-en-respiracion-asistida-crecen-los-ingresos-pero-no-compensan-la-deuda-cronificada.html)). In this goldmine, the **English Premier League** is leading the ranks both for total income and betting returns.

Our dataset characteristics make it the **perfect toolkit** for a wide range of professionals who want to dive deep into the effective statistics of English football.

## 1\. The English Premier League dataset identikit

In contemporary football, familiarity with the **matchesâ€™ statistics** transforms amateurs into professionals.

Before our [English Premier League dataset](https://datahub.io/core/english-premier-league), investigating the figures from the home of football was laborious and often stressful. DataHub's repository now offers overarching data **from â€˜93-â€™94 up to the current season**, for a total of 32 files.

We value the football industry professionalsâ€™ need for reliable information on a wide range of statistics. Thatâ€™s why we decided to address **more than 20 variables** for each game:

* Home and away **team**;
* **Date** and **referee**;
* **Results** and **goals** both at half-time and full-time.

For the ones looking for even more detailed information, we included also **each team**â€™s counts for:

* Total and on-target **shots**;
* **Fouls** committed;
* **Yellow** and **red cards**;
* **Corners**.

Last but not least, data visualization can be complex when dealing with large amounts of data, which is why you can easily consult our **previews** for the last five seasons of the English Premier League.

## 2\. Highlights \- The dataset features
