## Why Commodities Matter  

Commodities are the building blocks of the global economy. From powering cities with energy resources to fueling industries with raw materials, commodities play a critical role in everyday life. They're categorized into four primary groups: **Energy**, **Metals**, **Agriculture**, and **Livestock & Meat**.  

Each commodity's price movements are influenced by factors such as supply and demand, geopolitical events, and seasonal trends, making them fascinating to study and critical for decision-making in industries ranging from finance to logistics.
