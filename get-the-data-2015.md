There's increasing amounts of data publicly online. But it's often hard to find. Search engines or other automated tools may help. But ultimately this needs human intelligence -- and the wisdom of the crowd.

Ultimately "the best search engines are people". A data concierge service would therefore be valuable. The service could combine both community Q&A with an option for paid for personal service.

This a thesis we've had for quite a few years -- we even ran a [data Q&A site called the getthedata.org back in 2011](https://blog.okfn.org/2011/01/20/introducing-getthedataorg-ask-and-answer-data-related-questions/).

- However, its difficult to find on your own - search engines often work poorly as data is often hard to describe in a way computers can understand
- Even when you can find data, data quality and structure is often poor and the data needs cleaning and transforming to be immediately usable
