You might have heard it before: **data is the new gold**. The [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2021/02/why-is-it-so-hard-to-become-a-data-driven-company) disclosed that already in 2021, 91.9% of mainstream companies were investing in **big data and AI** development to optimize their decision-making processes. It would be no wonder if your own business was one of them.

Unluckily, the steeping numbers of information being produced every year can make their usage expensive in both money and energy. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/#:~:text=The%20total%20amount%20of%20data,replicated%20reached%20a%20new%20high.) estimated that the **gross amount of data being used in 2024 was 149 [zettabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettabyte_Era)**, with that figure estimated to almost reach 400 zettabytes in 2028\.

In 2025, being a data-driven company means **relying on professionals who can really make figures actionable and profitable**. That’s why the [DataHub.io](http://DataHub.io) team decided to craft dedicated solutions to empower clients’ innovation: we curate, tailor, and deliver the data you need, so you don’t have to.

In this article, you will get to understand why we are already being entrusted by governance organizations and world-leading delivery companies. **Why couldn’t be yours the next?**

## 1\. DataHub.io’s mission

[DataHub.io](http://DataHub.io) was born with a vision to drive the democratization of data, contributing to creating a more **equitable and innovative approach to data-driven decision-making**. P. Awasthi and Dr. J. George from [Texas A\&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) were not wrong to say that “the 21st century is quickly becoming the century of data” ([*A Case for Data Democratization*](https://core.ac.uk/reader/326836340), 2020), and we believe that making them **transparent and actionable** should be the foundation of our next future.

But what does democratizing data mean?

* Making big data **more accessible**;
* Improving **public access** to open data resources;
* **Sharing knowledge** on turning raw data into actionable insights;
* Ensuring **transparency** in how datasets are built and updated..

At its core, democratizing data means making data accessible, usable, and meaningful to as many people as possible \- regardless of their technical expertise or resources.

At DataHub.io, we take this a step further. We believe democratizing data requires a continuous effort to meet the unique needs of each user. Customization is a core pillar of our work: as data professionals, we understand that data must be refined, curated, and tailored to provide real value.

### Our Commitment to Excellence

Our mission extends far beyond hosting thousands of free datasets. We deliver **Premium Data Services** designed to meet the specific needs of businesses and professionals navigating complex information daily. From standardized offerings to fully customized solutions, Datahub.io ensures that our clients maximize the value of their data to achieve the best outcomes. Want to find out more? Delve deeper into [**our solutions’ specifics**](https://datahub.io/solutions) in the next paragraph.

## 2\. How our solutions are born

Democratizing data does not have to entail chaos, confusion, or unreliable resources. On the contrary, making large datasets accessible to the public requires **specialized expertise in data engineering, open-source programming**, and \- above all \- strong ethical principles.

In a world where data is often mistreated and misunderstood, we strive to make its democratization process profitable.

As underlined by [PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/great-expectations-study-reveals-77-of-organizations-have-data-quality-issues-301569359.html), a recent survey showed that **77% of practitioners have data quality issues**, with 9 out of 10 reporting that these problems significantly harm their company’s efficiency. To add to the challenge, a [McKinsey Report](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy) underlined that employees spend on average **1.8 hours daily searching and gathering information**, directly draining their business’ resources.
