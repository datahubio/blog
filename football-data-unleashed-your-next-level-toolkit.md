1. **Highlights \- what makes our collection crucial**

DataHub.io’s mission to democratize data extends to one of the most influential global industries: sports—specifically, football's financial power.

Up to the 2022/2023 season, the total revenues of European leagues altogether reached €35.5 billion, with the English Premier League alone recording a €7 billion profit. Most notably, the incomes of the **five major European leagues** have been constantly growing ever since 2010, with only a minor setback during the pandemic (source: [El País](https://elpais.com/economia/2024-11-13/las-grandes-ligas-europeas-de-futbol-en-respiracion-asistida-crecen-los-ingresos-pero-no-compensan-la-deuda-cronificada.html)).

But how does this growth translate to the wider economy?

Football financial management increasingly relies on debt, fostering an internal urge to constantly **seek high-return** projects and partnerships. This strategy, combined with football’s immense visibility, makes clubs perfect clients for other businesses’ advertisements and communication.

**Bookmaking** represents a parallel but not less profitable track. European revenues from online betting alone were $20 billion in 2023, and they are forecast to more than double in 30 years (source: [Custom Market Insights](https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/europe-online-sports-betting-market/)).

This growth is amplified by major international events, which offer prime opportunities for **global advertisement** and **gambling activities**. During the 2022 World Cup, FIFA's income from rights alone peaked at a record-high $6,314 million. The positive trend was mirrored by the 65% revenue increase for betting companies (source: Bloomberg).
