This is a "braindump" of a vision for "data literate documents" derived from the experience i would like to have publishing and sharing data and data driven documents.

## What I want ...

The basic need I have is:

> I want to write something like a README (in markdown)  with data and vis in it, preview it and publish it ...

I want to do this in a way that is simple and sustainable - I want to know this material will still be around and accessible in 5 or 10y (at the least). This likely means not doing this in a proprietary format or in a proprietary platform.

## Observations

* Markdown is becoming a lingua franca for writing developer and even research docs
  * It's quick and ascii-like
  * It's widely supported
  * It's extensible ...
* Frontend tooling is rapidly evolving ...
  * The distant between code and a tool is declining => I might as well write code ... (rather than using a specific tool to analysis and visualize data)
* MDX = Markdown + react
* RStudio did this a while ago ...
* Missing part is data ...
  * You have juputer notebooks etc ... => they are quite high end / geeky ...

Notebooks (jupyter, literate programming) âŸ¹

- Write text and code together
- Write code like in a terminal
- Data oriented

## Here the kinds of doc i want to write
