We're excited to announce that our open-source library, **R2 Bucket Uploader**, has just reached **100 stars** on GitHub! ðŸŽ‰ This milestone is a testament to the value it provides to the community, and we wanted to take a moment to highlight its key features and how it simplifies integrating with Cloudflare R2 storage.

### What is R2 Bucket Uploader?

**R2 Bucket Uploader** is a minimal and flexible uploader component tailored for **Cloudflare R2**, an S3-compatible object storage service. The tool supports **multipart uploads**, making it perfect for handling large files up to **10 GB** in size.

This uploader is built with **Next.js** and leverages **Uppy.io** for file uploads. Itâ€™s designed for simplicityâ€”just copy the components and API routes into your project, and youâ€™re ready to start uploading.

### Key Features

- **Multipart Upload Support**: Efficiently handles large file uploads with multipart support.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Easy file selection with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Pre-signed URL Support**: Secure, temporary URLs for uploading.
- **Customizable**: Built for flexibility, allowing easy integration into your existing workflows.

### How to Use

Install the dependencies for simple or multipart uploads, and set the necessary **environment variables** for Cloudflare R2. The library works out of the box, but you can easily customize it to suit your needs.

### Thank You to the Community
